# Vitalstyles

Makes it easy to document you LESS/SASS/CSS. You document your styles by inserting markdown with a few extensions to markup examples.


## Goals
Make it easier to document and develop styles.


## Features
- Document your styles with Markdown.
- Create live previews:
    - Inline in the guide for simple examples.
    - Covering the full width of the guide page for more complex examples.
    - Rendered in a full width IFRAME for really complex examples. These examples can also be opened in a separate file.


## Install
```
$ pip install vitalstyles
```

## How it works
You write your css/less/sass like you have always done, but you add markdown in special comments:

``` css
/**
# Buttons

## .fancybutton
A fancy button

$$$
<button class="fancy-button">Click me</button>
$$$
*/
.fancy-button {
}
```

The ``vitalstyles-cli`` can be executed from the directory containing the file with these styles, and it will create a style guide in ``vitalstyles_styleguide/``. By default it will search the current directory recursively for ``*.less``, ``*.sass``, ``*.scss`` and ``*.css`` files.


## Configuration
You can configure vitalstyles through a ``vitalstyles.json`` file. This is the default setting file with defaults:

``` javascript
{
    // Path to your CSS file relative to this settings file (or CWD if no settings file).
    // You have to set this to get previews.
    "preview_cssfile": null,

    // The output directory relative to the settings file (or CWD if no settings file).
    "outdir": "vitalstyles_styleguide",

    // A list of files or directories to parse.
    // Directories is searched recursively for ``.scss``,
    // ``.sass``, ``.css`` and ``.less`` files.
    "inpaths": [],

    // User defined templates directory. You can override any
    // templates in the ``vitalstyles/templates/`` directory
    // (in the repo) by putting them in a directory and specifying
    // the directory here. The path is relative to this settings file.
    "template_dir": null,

    // The title of the guide
    "title": "Vitalstyles style guide",

    // The subdirectory of ``outdir`` where we want to put isolated previews.
    "previewsdir": "previews",
}
```


## Embedded previews in the docs
If you want to get previews, you have to configure ``preview_cssfile`` in a ``vitalstyles.json``.


## Complete example
See the ``examples/`` directory in the source repo.


## Markdown dialect
The Markdown dialect is more or less the same as the GitHub format, with one additional tag to markup examples.

The Markdown parser is [python-markdown](https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/), with the following [extensions](https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/index.html):

### Fenced code blocks
Makes it possible to use github markdown styled code blocks like:

```
\`\`\` javascript
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
\`\`\`
```

### Sane lists
Renders lists in a saner manner than the original Markdown.

### Smart strong and smart emphasis
Prevents markdown from emphasizing words when you use ``_`` and ``__`` in the middle of a word.

### Definition Lists
Makes it possible to define definition lists with the following markup:

```
Option one
:   This is not a very good option. You should consider
    using _option two_.

Option two
:   This is a really good option.
```

### Tables
Makes it possible to create tables with the following markup:

```
First Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell  | Content Cell
```
